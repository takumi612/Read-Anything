# Attribution

This database is derived from the **MinhQND Dictionary** project (https://github.com/minhqnd/dictionary), with the primary enhancement being **generated learner-friendly example sentences**.

MinhQND Dictionary itself compiles data from multiple open-source dictionary and linguistic resources (Wiktionary, vntk/dictionary, and Hồ Ngọc Đức's Vietnamese Dictionary Project).

This project transforms and enhances the MinhQND data with additional example sentences and SQLite formatting.

## Repository Author

**Created and maintained by:** [Skypedia](https://github.com/skypediacode) (2026)

**Contributions:**

- Database processing and SQLite schema design
- Example sentence generation & standardization (replaced 18,636 fragment examples with complete exact-headword sentences)
- IPA fix for the original minhqnd data
- Local IPA backfill and database-wide pronunciation audit, resolving all missing English IPAs (100% coverage) using a safe G2P pipeline (lemmatization, affix stripping, and compound-word part-joining, backed by `g2p_en` neural fallback and an Oxford-compliant ARPAbet-to-IPA mapper).
- **Headword validation and correction:** Used [OVDP (Open Vietnamese Dictionary Project)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ovdp/) as reference to correct over 15,000 corrupted English headwords, including plural-to-singular normalization and common spelling errors (e.g., y → i)
- **Vocabulary & Idiom Enrichment:** Enriched the database with essential Starter Set vocabulary, over 1,350 common idioms, over 3,000 phrasal verbs, and core verb clusters (*make, get, look, come, take, put, turn, give, keep, bring, go, run, set, call, break, fall, hold*), complete with natural Vietnamese translations, Oxford IPA, and examples.
- Database optimization: removed invalid words, orphaned definitions, double-word/ordinal entries, noise words, unused columns, standardized pronunciations, and applied VACUUM (database now ~42 MB from the original 170 MB)
- Repository creation and documentation

This version builds upon and enhances the upstream sources through data curation, validation, and transformation into a comprehensive, queryable SQLite database.

## Dataset Processing

### Curation & Enhancement

This dataset has undergone:

- **Filtering:** Removal of non-learner-friendly entries; removed 215 noise words (non-ASCII or special chars)
- **Validation:** Verification of English-Vietnamese translation pairs
- **Spell-checking:** Pipeline to detect and fix 4,444 spelling errors
- **IPA fix:** Corrected IPA data from the original minhqnd source and resolved all missing English IPAs to achieve 100.0% coverage database-wide using a custom G2P neural-fallback pipeline.
- **Enrichment:** Addition and enhancement of example sentences for educational use (upgraded 18,636 fragment examples to complete sentences containing exact headwords)
- **Formatting:** Normalization for SQLite storage and efficient querying
- **Optimization:** Removed invalid words and orphaned definitions, double-word/ordinal entries, standardized pronunciations, dropped unused columns and analysis tables, VACUUM applied (database now ~42 MB from the original 170 MB)

### Example Sentences

Example sentences in this dataset were generated and validated to create learner-friendly educational content. They are designed to:

- Illustrate common word usage in practical contexts
- Support vocabulary acquisition for learners
- Facilitate contextual understanding of word meanings

These generated examples are an integral part of the processed dataset distributed by this repository.
