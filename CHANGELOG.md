# Read-Anything

## 0.1.0

- First Read-Anything release. Offline English–Vietnamese lookup, PDF and EPUB reading, annotations, bookmarks, reading statistics, optional AI, and Windows source builds.
- Forked from Marginalia. Earlier entries below are the upstream project's historical changelog.

## 0.18.5

### Patch Changes

- 6493c69: Fix assistant replies stalling while the model calls a tool. With fast models, the reply text could freeze for several seconds and then appear all at once when the tool finished; it now streams smoothly the whole way through.
- c4547a4: Assistant replies now fade in as they stream. New text appears the moment it arrives and settles in with a soft trailing fade instead of popping onto the screen. The effect is turned off when your system asks for reduced motion.

## 0.18.4

### Patch Changes

- b4d91b9: Show when each chat message was sent. Hovering a message now floats its full date and time just above the bubble — the spot the assistant's name used to occupy, which is gone now — and the conversation gets a "Today" / "Yesterday" / date divider wherever it crosses into a new day, so scrolling back through a long-lived conversation reads as a record instead of a flat stream.

## 0.18.3

### Patch Changes

- 8ff16ec: Show what the assistant is doing while a reading report generates. The report card now displays a live timeline of each step — collecting your annotations, listing conversations, sending a helper into a long one, rereading the text — with the elapsed time, how many steps are done, and which steps were skipped. Steps that run at the same time appear side by side, and if generation fails the timeline stays put so you can see where it stopped.
- a95f3a3: Stop reading reports from failing to generate when the report model spends its whole output budget on reasoning. The report agent no longer imposes a fixed output cap, so reasoning models can think through a long reading and still write the report.
- b1b8990: Base reading reports on the whole reading instead of a fragment of it. The report assistant now sees how large each conversation is, delegates long ones to a helper that reads them end to end, and can go back for your exact words on anything the helper flags. Reports no longer stop short because the assistant ran out of steps mid-conversation, and long Chinese conversations are no longer cut roughly four times shorter than English ones. Report generation also stops competing with background summaries for your configured concurrency.
- 5d1c644: Let reading reports see a long conversation in full. Once a conversation grew long enough to be compacted, the report assistant could only read the turns after that point — in one real reading, 110 of 470 messages — so reports covered the tail of a conversation and missed where it started. Compacting never deleted anything, so the assistant now reads the whole conversation and treats the rolling summary as background.

## 0.18.2

### Patch Changes

- 3bb8cc9: Open long conversations directly at the newest message instead of starting at the top, which also stops the panel from loading a spurious extra page of history.
- 4875910: Fix reading progress silently not being saved after a slow position restore times out.

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- 782e075: Weight EPUB reading progress by readable text so uneven file packaging no longer distorts the percentage, and keep restored locations stable across very long sections.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- d603bb3: Add compact backups that keep all app data while omitting heavyweight original book files, with database-only restore that preserves local book files.
- cc4de23: Add explicit reading sessions with session-aware reading time and editable AI-generated completion reports grounded in the reader's annotations, notes, and conversations. Reports use the current assistant context, organize durable memory, hide internal metadata, and can be safely regenerated or stopped without losing existing content.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 8775ec2: Add DB-level infinite loading/pagination to the AI message list, improving first-screen render performance for long conversations.
- bf2e3ea: Show visible preparation and thinking status while the assistant responds, without exposing reasoning content. Assistant identity now appears immediately after submission, tool activity takes over at the right time, and completed reasoning returns to preparation until the next tool or answer begins.
- 3625240: Render common inline and display LaTeX delimiters in AI replies, book summaries, and saved book notes, with wide formulas scrolling inside their container.
- 769a17c: Add a configurable reasoning effort (Off / Low / Medium / High) for the chat and summary models in Settings → Models. Leave it on Default to use the provider's own default. Off disables reasoning where the model supports it.

### Patch Changes

- 80efb84: Keep AI replies pinned only while the message viewport is at the bottom, so streaming no longer interrupts browsing or text selection. Returning to the bottom resumes following, while opening an existing conversation still scrolls smoothly to its latest message.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- f214f79: The library assistant now keeps its own conversations. Opening it no longer shows a conversation left over from a book you were just reading, and it remembers and restores your last library conversation when you come back to the library. Its empty state also reads sensibly outside a book.
- a53df57: The in-book AI assistant can now reach your whole library: ask it to compare the current book with others you've read, recall highlights and notes from any book, or check your reading stats — without leaving the book. It also gained a direct way to fetch the current book's whole-book summary.

### Patch Changes

- abeae14: Fixed the in-book AI assistant reading and summarizing only a sliver of some EPUB chapters. When a chapter's text is split across several internal files (common in many EPUBs), the assistant previously saw just the first fragment — often only the chapter title and opening line — and missed the rest of the body. It now reads the chapter in full.
- eae95b2: AI memories are now purely global notes about you, no longer tied to the book they happened to be recorded in. The memory list in Settings no longer shows a source-book label, and memories are fully independent of your library — removing a book never touches them.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d35b47: Give the AI companion awareness of the current date and time. Each turn now injects the wall-clock time (in your local timezone, ISO 8601 with offset) into the live message sent to the model, so it can answer time-relative questions ("how recent is this", "what year is it now") and reason about recency instead of guessing. The timestamp rides along only on the current turn — it never enters the cached system prefix and is never persisted, so it stays accurate every turn without disturbing prompt caching.
- c3fee3c: Added an optional background pass that periodically catches up on memories the assistant missed and tidies existing ones, with a low-key toast when it runs. Off by default — enable it under Settings → Memory.
- 43ade04: Add a library AI companion: a floating assistant in the library lets you chat with your AI assistant about your whole collection, not just one open book. It can browse your catalog, summaries, notes, highlights, and reading stats through tools — and, grounded in its memory of you, discuss your shelf and recommend what to read next. The same assistant panel is reused everywhere (including its conversation list and web-search toggle); conversations are no longer tied to a single book.
- fab63cf: Add an AI web search tool. Turn on the web search button in the AI panel's context row and the assistant can search the web (powered by Exa) for current or external information beyond the book — searches show up as a step in the reply and sources are linked inline. Works out of the box: Exa's free tier needs no API key. It's off by default; flip it on (the choice is remembered) and optionally add an Exa API key under Settings → Web search for higher rate limits. Backends are pluggable with automatic fallback so you can point it at another MCP search server.

### Patch Changes

- d516a4c: Enable prompt caching for Anthropic (Claude) models, cutting cost and first-token latency on multi-turn conversations. The stable prefix that gets resent every turn — system prompt, tools, and prior messages — is now marked as cacheable (a fixed breakpoint on the system prompt plus rolling breakpoints on the last two turns), so repeated context is billed at the reduced cache-read rate and processed faster instead of re-charged in full each time. Caching is applied through a per-provider strategy layer: Claude (which has no implicit caching) gets explicit cache breakpoints, while OpenAI, Gemini, and OpenAI-compatible providers (e.g. DeepSeek) are passed through untouched since they cache long prefixes automatically server-side.
- 9c2e2e8: Fix PDF zoom interactions. Pinch and Ctrl+scroll now stay anchored to the cursor (and the toolbar +/− buttons and percentage input to the viewport center) instead of jumping to a different page — including during continuous pinch gestures, which previously drifted unpredictably. Zooming no longer flashes white: pages stay visible by stretching the current frame during the gesture and re-rendering to the new resolution once it settles, swapped in through an offscreen buffer so the canvas is never cleared on screen. Pinch/scroll sensitivity is also increased for a more responsive feel.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b1dab8d: Add a customizable assistant avatar shown in conversation. Upload your own image (or keep the built-in default) in Settings → Agent; the avatar appears beside the assistant's messages along with its name, grouped so consecutive replies show it once. The avatar can be toggled off in settings.
- 8945d88: Crop the assistant avatar when uploading: pick an image, frame it with a round 1:1 crop (zoom + drag), and only the cropped result is saved.
- ca4c3eb: Recover from missing book files: when a book's stored copy is gone, the reader now shows a recovery panel offering to relink the original file (restoring reading progress and annotations) or remove the book from the library, instead of a dead error message.

### Patch Changes

- b46de4d: Fix epub highlights showing no chapter in single-file books where every chapter shares one spine file (table of contents split by anchors). Annotation chapter lookup now subdivides such a shared file to the correct anchor chapter using boundary CFIs precomputed when the book opens. Multi-file books are unaffected.
- 75b3644: Add a lightweight update check: the app now checks GitHub Releases on startup and shows a toast when a newer version is available, plus a "Check for updates" button in Advanced settings. It only notifies and links to the release page (no auto-download/install yet).
- 5862712: Fix the selection toolbar's "Ask AI" action wiping out text you'd already typed in the chat composer. It now attaches the selected passage as context and keeps your draft intact, so you can finish the question you started. The preset actions (Explain / Translate / Summarize) still fill in their prompt as before.
- fd0cb40: Add a configurable global concurrency cap for background AI tasks (chapter/book summaries, conversation naming, and long-conversation compaction). Set it in Settings → Advanced (default 3); excess tasks queue and run as slots free up. Foreground chat replies are never throttled.
- c993045: Fix epub highlights showing the wrong chapter (or none) in the annotations sidebar. Chapter lookup matched a CFI's spine position against the TOC-based order index — two different numbering bases — so any book with a cover or front-matter page before its chapters was mislabeled. Annotations now resolve their chapter from the spine href, the same way current-chapter tracking already does.
- f096fab: Fix AI chat failing partway through a tool-calling turn when using an OpenAI Responses–API provider (notably third-party gateways) with a reasoning model. The request used to error with "Item … not found. Items are not persisted when `store` is set to false." Reasoning is now sent inline instead of as a server-side id reference, so tool-calling conversations complete on stateless endpoints. Also fixed the send-failure hint that always told you to configure an "Anthropic" API key regardless of the provider you'd set up — it now refers to your API key and model generically.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 9101f4a: Add read-aloud (TTS) for ePub books: play from the current position with automatic chapter continuation, paragraph highlight that follows the speech, a floating control bar (pause/resume/stop/speed), and per-language voice selection with preview in Settings. Voices are matched to the content language of each paragraph, not the UI language.

### Patch Changes

- 7f6b774: Reduce blank flashes when scrolling quickly through ePub books. Sections above and below the viewport now pre-mount and load further ahead, so their content is ready by the time it scrolls into view instead of briefly showing an empty placeholder.
- a33c870: Fix large position jumps when scrolling up in ePub books. Section iframes now keep their estimated height from the moment they mount (previously they collapsed to the browser default for a few frames while reloading, forcing the reader to compensate mid-scroll), unmeasured sections are estimated from chapter text length instead of a fixed placeholder, and sections above the viewport pre-mount earlier so height corrections happen off-screen.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 72f7925: Add standalone book-level notes: write multiple Markdown notes per book from the reader sidebar's new Notes tab, or review them from the library via right-click → View notes — no text selection required.
- d2ee886: Book note editing now uses a syntax-highlighted Markdown editor (CodeMirror): headings render larger, bold/italic/code/quotes show their real styling as you type, markers are dimmed, and lists auto-continue on Enter.
- 768751f: Make the reader's sidebar and AI panel resizable: drag the inner edge of either pane to adjust its width. Widths are remembered across restarts, and the collapsed peek drawers follow the chosen width.

### Patch Changes

- c357b76: Import EPUB books that are unpacked directories instead of zip files (for example, books exported from Apple Books, or epubs unzipped by Calibre/Sigil). These previously failed to import with an `EISDIR` error; they are now packed into a standard EPUB on import. Directories that aren't valid EPUBs, or whose contents can't be read (e.g. not-yet-downloaded iCloud placeholders), now report a clear, actionable error.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- ab3d830: Your reading companion now has a name (Lia by default), an editable persona, and a global long-term memory: it remembers your preferences, viewpoints, and recurring concepts across books and conversations, with full review/edit/delete control in Settings → Memory. Custom instructions replace the old assistant system prompt, and your existing chat model configuration is migrated automatically.
- 9cbd370: Add a gentle first-run onboarding card to the library that guides you to connect an AI model and turn on automatic chapter summaries. Skippable anytime, and it disappears once you're set up.
- bee788c: Seed a built-in localized sample book into the library on first launch, so new readers have something to open, annotate, and try AI on right away. It is a normal, deletable book and won't come back once removed.

### Patch Changes

- 3594ad3: PDF reading polish: reopening a book now restores your exact in-page scroll position (not just the page), highlights with notes show a dotted bottom edge so you can spot them at a glance, and you can zoom smoothly with Ctrl+wheel or trackpad pinch — anchored at your cursor.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 5eb8751: Add data backup & restore: export your whole library (books, annotations, reading progress, conversations, settings) to a single zip, and restore it on any machine. Restore replaces current data after a confirmation and keeps a pre-restore safety copy, then relaunches. Backups include your provider API keys in plaintext — the export dialog warns you to keep the file private.

### Patch Changes

- 1b51661: Sort the annotations panel by creation time with the newest first, instead of by reading position — so freshly added highlights and notes always appear at the top.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a3740e: Add reading-time tracking with a dedicated Stats tab: total / today / last-7-days, a daily reading chart, reading streaks, and per-book time ranking. Navigation now uses Apple Books-style top pill tabs (Library / Stats).

### Patch Changes

- Show a pending placeholder in the AI panel while a reply is being submitted, so it's clear your request was sent before the assistant starts streaming.
- c0e2e48: Fix the AI assistant pretending to call reading tools in longer conversations. Past assistant turns now replay their real tool calls and results in history (instead of being flattened to text), so the model keeps actually reading the book instead of imitating a tool-free transcript.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 4cbe610: Add a configurable step limit for AI replies (Advanced settings). The default agent step cap is raised from 5 to 10, and you can set any value from 1–99 or choose "Unlimited" — helpful for page-by-page PDF reading where the AI needs more tool-call steps to gather context.
- c0f3eca: Keep long AI conversations focused. Once a conversation's recent history grows past a large budget, older turns are folded in the background into a rolling summary while recent turns stay verbatim, so the prompt sent to the model stays bounded instead of growing without limit. This curbs the cost, latency, and quality drift (the assistant losing focus or skipping tool calls) that long reading sessions used to cause. Existing conversations are unaffected until they cross the threshold, and the summary is derived state only — your message history is never altered.

### Patch Changes

- 3ac5f03: Auto-focus the AI panel input after triggering an AI action (ask/explain/translate/summarize, opening a conversation, or starting a new one), so you can type a follow-up immediately without an extra click.
- 77f49f5: Surface previously-silent failures in the AI streaming pipeline. When the main process couldn't push a stream chunk to the renderer (for example a payload that fails structured clone), the error was swallowed with nothing written to the logs; the chat stream's client-side errors were likewise never recorded. Both paths now emit warnings, and each agent step's finish reason is logged in development. So when an AI reply stalls or a requested tool call doesn't fire, there's a diagnostic trail to follow instead of silence.
- f73fe67: Mark books as finished in your library. Right-click a book and choose "Mark as finished" to flag it as read — a green check badge appears on its cover, and the book drops off the "Continue reading" shelf. Choose "Unmark as finished" to undo. The book's right-click menu now also shows an icon beside each action.
- fd08446: Edit, resend, and regenerate AI chat messages. Hover a message in the AI panel to reveal actions: edit one of your earlier questions and resend it, resend it unchanged, or regenerate the assistant's reply. The conversation is truncated from that point and a fresh reply is streamed — useful for rephrasing, retrying a failed reply, or getting an alternative answer.
- 837f323: Fix the provider connection test failing for reasoning models (such as Kimi K2.6) with a baffling "failed: HTTP 200" message. The connectivity probe only requested a single output token — far too little for a reasoning model to even begin its internal reasoning — so the provider returned an incomplete HTTP 200 response that surfaced as a self-contradictory failure (a success status code reported as an error). The probe now allows enough output budget for reasoning models, a 2xx response that still can't be parsed now reports an honest diagnostic instead of a bare status code, and the test failure — previously swallowed with nothing written to the logs — is now recorded as a warning.
- 1fecb84: Add a copy button to AI chat messages. Hovering (or keyboard-focusing) any message in the AI panel reveals a small toolbar; the copy action places the message's markdown source on the clipboard, so you can paste a reply into notes or feed it back into another prompt. Works for both AI replies and your own messages.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e8fdbf: ePub reader now navigates at anchor granularity: clicking a chapter or an in-text link scrolls to the exact #fragment anchor, external links open in the system browser, and current-chapter highlight follows the anchor you're reading as you scroll. Reading position is restored to the exact paragraph you left off at — even for books that pack the whole text into one or two large HTML files, where it previously snapped back to the beginning. Also fixes a white screen when clicking in-text hyperlinks (the sandboxed iframe used to navigate itself to an invalid URL).
- 7b11735: ePub reader now recognizes chapters anchored within shared spine files (e.g. Calibre/Epubor exports that pack a whole book into one or two HTML files). The table of contents, AI chapter tools, and chapter text all resolve at #fragment-anchor granularity instead of collapsing to per-file chapters. Existing books upgrade automatically on next open.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- a3cbff4: Add a hover card that previews a highlight's note in both the ePub and PDF readers. Hover an annotated selection to see its quote and note, move into the card to read long notes, and click Edit to jump straight to the note editor.
- 6be4c93: Remember each book's last-active AI conversation and restore it on reopen, and fix the previous book's conversation lingering in the AI panel after switching books.

### Patch Changes

- 5aeebea: Fix ePub imports being wrongly rejected as "already in your library"

  Some ePubs (notably ones from certain online sources) ship with a non-unique boilerplate identifier, so two completely different books could carry the same `dc:identifier`. Marginalia used that identifier as a book's identity, which made it silently refuse to import the second book as a duplicate. Book identity now derives from the file's content hash — the same approach already used for PDFs — so distinct books always import correctly, while re-importing the exact same file stays de-duplicated.

- 4522516: Respect IME composition when pressing Enter. In the chat composer and the manual model-name input, Enter no longer sends/submits while an East Asian input method (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) is composing — confirming a candidate with Enter now commits the text instead of firing off a half-composed message. Shift+Enter still inserts a newline.
- 8faea92: Stop a book from being dragged while you interact with its dialog in the library

  Opening a book's "Edit info" (or delete confirmation) dialog from the library and then pressing and moving the pointer anywhere inside it would accidentally start dragging and reordering the book underneath. These dialogs render in a portal, so their pointer events still bubbled through React's component tree to the draggable book card. The grid now only begins a drag when the gesture actually starts on the card itself, so you can freely click and drag inside dialogs.

- 2570842: Keep the library header fixed while only the book grid scrolls

  The library view used to scroll as a whole — header included — whenever the window was short or held many books, and the page background could stop short of the scrolled content. The header now stays pinned while only the book grid scrolls inside the same subtle macOS-style overlay scrollbar used elsewhere in the app, and the background always fills the view.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d6a5e93: You can now edit a book's title and author right from the library: right-click a book cover and choose "Edit details". This finally gives you a way to clean up messy metadata from repackaged files (site-suffixed titles, garbled authors) or name books that imported without a title — no more deleting and re-importing. Leaving the author field empty shows the book as "Unknown author"; titles can't be empty. Changes show up immediately on the library card and inside the reader.
- 2065af2: Conversations in the sidebar can now be deleted — right-click one or hover and hit the trash icon, then confirm. Deleting the conversation you're currently in clears the AI panel back to a fresh-start state, and if the AI is mid-reply for it, the stream is stopped cleanly. All of the conversation's messages are removed with it.
- d10e0dd: Add a "Continue reading" shelf, manual library ordering, and reading progress display
  - **Continue reading shelf**: the library now shows your 3 most recently read books above the grid, as info cards with cover, title, author, and a reading progress bar. Click a card to jump back in. The shelf hides itself until you've read something.
  - **Drag to reorder**: rearrange books in the library grid by dragging. Your custom order persists; newly imported books land at the front.
  - **Reading progress in the reader**: the header breadcrumb now shows how far you are — a percentage for ePubs, page numbers plus percentage for PDFs (e.g. `12 / 304 · 4%`).

- 24616f3: Marginalia now keeps persistent logs, so problems can be diagnosed after the fact instead of vanishing with the session. Notable events — errors, AI pipeline hiccups, import and migration activity — are written to daily log files (kept for 30 days) under the app's data directory, with main-process and reader-window logs stored in separate files. A new "Advanced" section in Settings provides an "Open logs folder" button so you can grab the files when reporting an issue.

  Crashes and silent failures leave traces too: the reader window now reports script errors and component crashes (showing a friendly reload screen instead of a blank page), and operations that used to fail invisibly — AI tool calls, summary generation, reading-progress saves — are all recorded.

### Patch Changes

- 2eb00ab: Tool-call steps in AI replies now appear inside the assistant bubble, inline with the response text in the order they happened, instead of stacking as separate cards above it. Each step is a compact one-line row with a human-readable description — "Reading page 12" or "Reading “Preface”" rather than raw tool names — and a live status (loading / done / failed). Failed steps are shown honestly in red, so you can see the AI correct itself and retry. Works for past conversations too.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d9107a: Marginalia now reads PDFs as first-class citizens alongside ePubs. Import them by drag & drop or file picker (untitled files take their name from the file), and read with crisp canvas rendering, smooth zoom (±10% steps from 25% to 500%, with a directly editable percentage that's remembered across restarts), dark-mode inversion, and reading-progress restore. Outlines become the chapter list, the first page becomes the library cover, and scanned PDFs are detected at import — readable as always, with AI text features clearly disabled instead of failing silently.

  Everything you do in ePubs works in PDFs too: select text to ask the AI (surrounding context included) or to create highlights and notes — overlays survive restarts and zoom, click one to recolor, annotate, or delete, and the sidebar lists every annotation with its page for one-click navigation. Links inside PDFs are clickable (both embedded link annotations and plain-text URLs), opening externally in your browser. The AI gains a page-level reading tool — it can read any page by number, look at rendered page images on vision-capable providers, and it now knows where you currently are in the book, so "what am I reading?" just works.

  Typography matches desktop-class PDF viewers: CMap and standard-font data ship with the app so external CJK encodings decode correctly, and fonts that aren't embedded (common in repacked books) render through curated substitution chains — heiti headings stay heiti, songti body text stays songti, and western faces like Times, Garamond, or Palatino map to the closest installed font.

### Patch Changes

- e0ccc92: Settings and all locally stored data (providers, models, annotations, library) now load and save correctly while offline — local database access is no longer paused when the network is down.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5fa6417: The chapter summary pill moves to the reader top bar, and the composer gets a unified context pill row — hover any pill to preview its content, dashed borders mark missing summaries, and the selection context can be removed before sending.
- 32af005: Conversations are no longer tied to chapters — keep one continuous conversation while reading across chapters. Summaries become user-controlled context chips, and conversations get AI-generated titles after the first reply.
- a1eb1bb: Add an independent summary model setting. Chapter summaries, book summaries, and conversation auto-naming now use a separately configured model (Settings → Models → Summary model) instead of sharing the chat model, so you can route background tasks to a faster, cheaper model. The summary model must be configured explicitly — when unset, manual summary generation shows a clear error, and auto-naming is skipped. Also fixes reader layout persistence, which previously never survived restarts.

### Patch Changes

- 2887ba4: Toggling a summary chip now surfaces generation errors (e.g. "Summary model is not configured") as a toast instead of failing silently.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 53a7a98: Switch body font in reading preferences: book default, LXGW WenKai (楷体), serif (Fraunces + Noto Serif SC), or sans (Manrope + Noto Sans SC) — CJK fonts bundled, applies to all books

### Patch Changes

- Fix first launch showing a blank window and prompting for keychain access after every update (cookie-encryption fuse retired — the app keeps no cookies and no longer touches the keychain)
- 53a7a98: Fix images sometimes failing to appear on first paint when opening a book
- 53a7a98: Fix macOS Gatekeeper rejecting downloaded builds (ad-hoc code signing)
- 9e2a97b: Fix the collapsed left sidebar's hover drawer having a transparent background (reader text showed through)
- 86264b2: Fix chapter/book summary status getting stuck on "pending" after the summary was generated, and surface a clear error toast (e.g. missing API key) when generating a summary fails instead of silently doing nothing

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
